 Ultimate X and O Showdown

A fun and interactive Java Swing-based Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game, built originally from a logic shared by our lecturer — and extended with colorful UI, player tracking, and a complete multi-page game flow.



 How It Started

This project began in class when our lecturer gave us a simple code snippet that handled the basic logic for an X and O game. It was a one-page layout with buttons and conditions for switching turns. No names, no score tracking, no real UX — just core logic.


 How We Took It Further

We built from that basic logic and transformed it into a full experience:

 Features Added:
Welcome Page:Players input names before the game starts — with a styled greeting message.
Game Page: Clean and scalable 3x3 grid with turn switching logic. UI styled for better vibes.
Score Page: Displays win/loss/draw result with **"Play Again"** and **"Quit"** buttons.
Player Tracking: Keeps track of who played what, and handles turns smoothly.
